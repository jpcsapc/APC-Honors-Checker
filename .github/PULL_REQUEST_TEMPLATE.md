## Description

<!-- Briefly describe what this PR does. -->

# Release Notes

<!--
  If this PR is user-facing, add the `release-note` label and follow the
  format below exactly.

  - Use `# Release Notes` (H1) as the section trigger — the automation
    looks for this exact heading.
  - Each `## Feature Title` (H2) becomes a notification heading in the toast.
  - The plain text below each H2 becomes the description shown to users.
  - Delete this entire section for internal-only PRs (refactors, CI, deps).
